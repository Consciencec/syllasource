Overcoming depression is a recurring theme in my life and all of life as well. In my un-professional opinion I do not believe depression is an ailment that can be cured, it is simply a feeling that can be treated. You can take all the pills in the world and sit through hours of therapy sessions and never make any progress towards solving the root of the problem. 

Sometimes I think to myself if there even is a root cause of depression. It seams totally natural to feel down about life sometimes. Is it possible depression is just a by product of the human experience? Not sure, in fact that statement alone makes me feel like a pseudo intellectual and or charlatan.

The best thing to do is to keep moving forward. Towards what? I am not exactly sure. Depression is defiantly treatable. Diet and exercise are apparently great for for this, however I find junk food and binge-watching TV are also great mood lifters (again un-professional opinion). It's important to manage relationships with friends and family, a skill I need to practice.

It's easy to get mad at your parents, they brought you into the world without even asking you. They have have a burning desire to teach their kids all they know despite still needing to learn a lot themselves. 

To summarize the purpose of this message, be kind to your family and friends (pets too). They are a great reason to keep moving forward towards a happier life.
