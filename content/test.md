Overcoming depression is a recurring theme in my life and all of life in general.
In my non-professional opinion I don't believe depression is an ailment
that can be cured, it is simply a feeling that you get. You can take all the pills in the world
and sit through hours of therapy sessions and never make any progress towards solving the root of this condition. 

All we can do is keep moving forward, towards what? I am not exactly sure. 
Depression is defiantly treatable. Diet and exercise are apparently great for fending off depression. 
However, I find junk food and binge-watching TV are also great mood lifters (again non-professional opinion).
It's important to manage relationships with friends and family too, a skill I need to practice.

It's easy to get mad at your parents, they brought you into the world without even asking you first. 
They have have a burning desire to teach their kids all they know despite still needing to learn themselves.
This first post is kind of all over the place and I don't think it's very helpful.

To summarize the purpose of this message, be kind to your family and friends (pets too). 
They are a great reason to keep moving forward towards a happier life.
